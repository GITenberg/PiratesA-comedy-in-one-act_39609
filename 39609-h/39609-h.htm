<blockquote><p><i>The play takes place in <span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren's</span> little
living room during the early Victorian period.
At the left is a door leading to another part of
the house. A door at the back opens into the
entrance hall. As the curtain rises, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren</span>,
seated in a large chair, is talking to her
maid, <span class="smcap">Clara</span>.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Gossip is malicious, my dear girl,
positively malicious. Doesn't the Bible say&mdash;(<i>The
knocker sounds.</i>) There, isn't that the door? (<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span>
starts to go</i>.) Oh, Clara, before you open the door,
be sure and dust off the table in the hall and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> goes out. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren</span> arranges her dress
and the little lace cap on her head.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> (<i>From the door</i>) It's Mrs. Lawty,
ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Oh, the dear soul! Have her
come right in&mdash;right in, Clara.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> goes out. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty</span> enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Good afternoon&mdash;good afternoon,
Mrs. Warren.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Good afternoon, my dear. Do sit
down, Mrs. Lawty&mdash;do sit down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Oh, thank you. I have just dropped
in for a moment. I am on my way to the meeting
of the "Helping Hand Society," and as I had to pass
this way I just came in to see how you were. I hope
I am not interrupting any work you may be doing,
my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Oh, dear, no. I was just giving
my maid a little lecture ... on gossip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Gossip?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> It is <i>so</i> malicious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Positively unladylike! One could
almost compare a lady who gossips to a ... to a
pirate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> A what, Mrs. Lawty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> A pirate. They are sort of wild
thieves, you know, and steal things from perfectly
innocent people, Mrs. Warren. The South Sea
Islands are full of them ... pirates, I mean. Why,
I read in our missionary paper, just last week, that
one poor man was overtaken by pirates who took
away his watch and, I hesitate to say it, his trousers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> His trousers! Dreadful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> The rest of the story is too indelicate
to repeat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Yes ... yes, some things are often
better left unsaid. (<i>Pause.</i>) But one need
never be ashamed to speak the truth. What is the
rest of the story, Mrs. Lawty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> The poor man was forced to come
into port with a bad cold in his head ... and in his
pajamas!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> And that is why I call a woman who
gossips a pirate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Yes ... yes. Though one can
hardly think of <i>any</i> woman unlawfully taking a poor
gentleman's trousers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Hardly. But to steal one's good
name is to take one's cloak of righteousness, so to
speak. And, oh, my dear, few people can face the
world without it. The soul is so much more important
than the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> One should keep <i>both</i> properly
clothed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Yes ... though on the South Sea
Islands the people wear nothing but grass skirts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> One could hardly do that in England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Oh, but the people there, in the
South Seas, are like little children ... pure of
mind. And so it is one of the very first rules of the
"Helping Hand Society" that no gossip shall pass
our lips.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Such a worthy organization. I
am sure the ladies of Northampton are doing a noble
work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Oh, yes, indeed, Mrs. Warren.
Why, only last week we sent off a large box of soap
to the natives of East Africa and now we are getting
a box of napkins and tablecloths ready. We are doing
such splendid work for our less fortunate brothers
and sisters in a far land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Brothers and sisters! One hardly
feels that way toward them, Mrs. Lawty. I am told
they are quite black.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Nevertheless they are Gaud's creatures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> My dear, I shall have Clara make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
you a hot cup of tea. It will rest you. (<i>She calls</i>)
Clara ... Clara!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Oh, no, thank you ... really. I
mustn't stop. I always like to get to the society meetings
early ... otherwise one misses so much that is
interesting. (<i>She rises.</i>)</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> appears.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Never mind, Clara. (<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span>
starts to go.</i>) Oh, Clara, Clara&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Clara, will you put the water on
to boil? And make the tea rather strong ... but
not too strong ... just so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Yes, ma'am. (<i>She goes out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> By the way, have you met the new
doctor and his wife, Mrs. Warren?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Yes, I have called on Mrs. Hunter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> (<i>She sits down again</i>) Oh, really?
How interesting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> But, of course, Betty knows both
of them. I must call on Mrs. Hunter again. But I
get out so seldom now ... so seldom. I am so
afraid to walk on the new ... pavement, I believe
they call it. Betty is very fond of them both ...
the Hunters, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Quite ... though Mrs. Romney
told Mrs. Pickering who told me that the Hunters
did not get along well together. It seems she is a
Church of England woman while the doctor is the
son of a Scotch Presbyterian, so of course&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Though I believe they have been
married all of five or six years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Oh, really, I did not know that.
How interesting! I must tell Mrs. Romney. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Mrs. Lawer told me that the doctor calls Mrs. Hunter
"Dearest" ... in public!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Such poor taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> I always suspect a man who is
over-demonstrative ... in public.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> But of course one&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Betty</span> comes running in, her arms full of
daisies.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Mother dear&mdash;&mdash; Oh, good afternoon,
Mrs. Lawty. See the wonderful flowers Doctor
Hunter just gave me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Doctor Hunter gave you those?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Doctor Hunter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Yes, his garden is full of them! Aren't
they beauties?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> But you hardly know him well
enough to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> You see we are getting acquainted. He
was on his way to see Mrs. Hallway and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Is she ill again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Rheumatism ... not really serious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Oh, really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> And as the doctor was coming this way,
he walked to the gate with me ... we had a lovely
chat. Doctor Hunter is such an interesting conversationalist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> (<i>Coldly</i>) Walking! Hasn't he a
carriage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Oh, yes, but it is such a wonderful day
for walking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> I daresay that all depends upon with
whom one is walking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Betty, you don't really mean to
tell me that you walked ... walked down a public
highway with a strange man!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Why, Mother, he isn't a strange man. I
know both Doctor and Mrs. Hunter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> But such a short acquaintance
... and to be walking with him ... walking with
him in broad daylight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> What would you have me do? Walk
with him after dark?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> (<i>When she recovers her breath</i>)
I&mdash;I really must be going, Mrs. Warren. I must not
be late to the meeting, you know. (<i>She pauses.</i>)
And perhaps you would rather be alone with your
daughter at this time. (<i>She rises.</i>) Good afternoon,
Mrs. Warren. Good afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Good afternoon, Mrs. Lawty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Good-bye.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty</span> goes out. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren</span> waits until
the front door slams before she speaks.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> (<i>Much concerned</i>) Betty, how
could you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> But, Mother&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Walking with a man, a man who
is married and not on the best terms with his wife,
accepting flowers from him, a Presbyterian, unchaperoned.
Oh! It is so unbecoming ... so&mdash;so
unladylike, not to say indiscreet. Oh! Why, when
I was a girl&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> I know. (<i>She goes close to her mother.</i>)
But things have changed so since then, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Not in Northampton, thank
heaven. Here, at least, we still keep some of the old
propriety. Oh, Betty, this bold indiscretion of yours
would have killed your poor, dear father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> (<i>Turning away</i>) Perhaps that's what <i>did</i>
... too much propriety.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Did you say something, Betty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> I am sorry, dear ... truly sorry if I
have caused you any anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> We must cultivate the doctor's
wife at once. There must be no room for gossip
among the ladies of Northampton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Cultivate Mrs. Hunter? Oh, I would love
to. She is a delightful person. Don't you like her,
Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> She seems very nice, but, of
course, one must be very careful about strangers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> She is very fond of outdoor life, and all
that sort of thing. Oh, she is a regular sport!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Betty! Let me never hear such a
remark from you again. Sport! Am I to understand,
then ... am I to understand that Mrs. Hunter
is one of those dreadful mannish sort of persons
who&mdash;&mdash; (<i>The knocker sounds.</i>) Oh, dear me! I
wonder who that can be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> If you don't mind, Mother, I shall go up
to my room. I want to do a water-color sketch of
these flowers while they are still fresh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Stop here a bit, Betty.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> enters from the hall.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> It is Mrs. Romney, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Oh, do have her come right in,
Clara ... and Clara, serve the tea at once. (<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span>
goes out.</i>) Mrs. Romney&mdash;oh, dear ... such a
bombastic sort of a person, so to speak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> She was educated in London, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Yes, poor dear, she has so much
to live down. It must be dreadful to have been educated
in London ... such a naughty place. Think
of the dreadful environment, my dear, London!</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney</span> enters.</i>)</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Good afternoon, Mrs. Warren.
How do you do, Betty, dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Do sit down, Mrs. Romney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Did I hear you speaking of London
as I came in, Mrs. Warren?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> London? Speaking of London?
Were we speaking of London, Betty? Yes, I believe
I did say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Dear old London ... how I
long for it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> But my dear Mrs. Romney, London
surely hasn't the ... the refinement of Northampton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Northampton! Ah! Why, this
place is as far from the world as ... as the South
Sea Islands!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Mrs. Romney, how&mdash;how can you
even think such a thing? Why, in the South Sea
Islands, I am told, the people wear nothing but straw
skirts ... and pirates, pirates take things&mdash;unmentionable
things from innocent travelers. One could
not accuse the people of Northampton of such things.
Even our shop-keepers are gentlemen compared to
those dreadful people who live in the South Seas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> The people of the South Sea
Islands are at least&mdash;interesting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Perfect savages!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> But, my dear, <i>all</i> our forefathers
were savages, you know ... hitting each other over
the head with clubs, hanging from palm trees by
their tails, and all that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Oh, dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> And the longer I live in Northampton,
my dear, the more I'm convinced that it
wasn't so very many generations ago, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Oh ... oh ... oh! Betty, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
may go! You will excuse the dear child, I am sure.
She has duties to perform which&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Oh, yes, certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> (<i>She rises and collects her flowers</i>)
Good afternoon, Mrs. Romney. Shall I see you at
Mrs. Hunter's tea Thursday?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Yes, dear, charmed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Good-bye.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney</span> bows. <span class="smcap">Betty</span> goes out left. <span class="smcap">Clara</span>
enters with the tea things.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> You will have a cup of tea, Mrs.
Romney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Yes, thank you so much. So refreshing,
nothing like tea for nerves, is there, really?
Half a cup ... I have just come from Mrs. Hunter's.
Both cream and sugar, yes, thank you so
much. Such a charming lady, Mrs. Hunter ...
perfectly charming, my dear, perfectly charming.
So witty, so clever, so vivacious ... but dreadfully
jealous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Jealous? Jealous of whom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> She is very fond of her husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> (<i>Nervously</i>) Of whom ... of
whom is she jealous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> No one in particular, at present,
I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> (<i>With a sigh of relief</i>) Oh&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> That is ... oh, is there any cause
for her being jealous of any particular person, Mrs.
Warren?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> (<i>Choking on her tea</i>) Eh? No
... no ... not that I know of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> How uninteresting. The doctor
is such a charming gentleman. Dear me, I do hope
I will have another attack of indigestion, or some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>thing
of that sort soon. I am sure Doctor Hunter
would be such a splendid physician ... he is so
good looking. (<i>She puts down her teacup.</i>) Dear
me, I must be going. I am on my way to the meeting
of the "Helping Hand Society" and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Yes, Mrs. Lawty has just gone.
She dropped in to see me for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Mrs. Lawty ... that one? I'm
not speaking to her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Oh, dear, you ... you don't
really mean you have quarrelled? So unladylike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Ladylike ... ladylike? Ladylike
be damned!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> (<i>Almost jumping out of her
chair</i>) Mrs. Romney!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Mrs. Warren, I beg your pardon.
I forgot, for a moment, to whom I was speaking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> That was quite evident.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Quite. But you see, Mrs. Lawty
told Mrs. Pickering, who told Mrs. Lawer, who told
Lady Bloshire, whose maid told my maid, that Mrs.
Lawty said that I dyed my hair ... dyed my hair!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> I've never dyed my hair. The
impertinent gossip. The&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> (<i>Quickly</i>) Do have another cup
of tea, Mrs. Romney. It is so soothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney</span>. Oh, thank you. Just a little
sugar, please, and no cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> (<i>Giving her the tea</i>) There, my
dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Lovely color, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Yes, isn't it? Mr. Warren, dear
man, once told me that the natives of India use tea
for dyeing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Hair?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> No ... no ... cloth, I believe,
cloth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Oh, how interesting!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> I believe they use the henna berry
for dyeing hair in the East. I am told it gives a
beautiful soft auburn shade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> How interesting. Does one procure
it from one's pharmacist?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Eh? Oh, yes, I believe so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> I must try it on my hair&mdash;oh, dear,
I mean&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> What did you say, Mrs. Romney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> I said&mdash;I really must be going,
my dear. One never seems to realize how fast the
time goes when one talks with you. Our little visit
has been most interesting ... and most instructive.
I do want to stop in for a moment and see Mrs.
Hallway before I go to the meeting of the "Helping
Hand." Her rheumatism is worse again, poor
dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Yes, so I heard. I'm <i>so</i> sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Oh, it is not at all serious, just a
touch, I believe. Of course she did call in Doctor
Hunter. But I really believe it was simply to get
acquainted with him more than anything else. (<i>She
starts.</i>) Do drop in and see me when you can.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Warren. (<i>She goes out.</i>)</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Shall I take away the tea things, ma'am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> No ... no, not just yet, Clara.
Someone else may drop in, you know, and perhaps
Betty would like a cup of tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Shall I call her, ma'am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Yes, I believe you had bet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>&mdash;&mdash;
(<i>The knocker sounds.</i>) There, there, see who that
is, Clara.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> goes into the hall. She returns immediately.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> It's Mrs. Pickering, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Have her come right in, Clara.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Shall I call Miss Betty, ma'am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Yes, do have her come down and
have a cup of tea.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> goes out. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering</span> enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> How do you do, Mrs. Warren?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Oh, good afternoon. Do sit
down, Mrs. Pickering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> Oh ... my dear Mrs. Warren,
I am so glad to see you looking so well. I
thought perhaps&mdash;of course there is much sickness
in Northampton now. (<i>She sits down.</i>) Much sickness.
(<i>Pause.</i>) I just met Mrs. Lawty and she
told me that Mrs. Hallway is almost dead with rheumatism
... almost dead. In fact, I think they
hardly expect her to live much longer. Of course,
Mrs. Lawty didn't say so, but I implied as much
from the tone of her voice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> I heard it was nothing really serious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> Oh, dear, yes ... very serious.
I just had it from Mrs. Lawty, who had it
from ... from ... from a most reliable source.
Rheumatism is such a painful death, too. Oh, dear,
poor soul ... poor soul! (<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren</span> hands
her a cup of tea.</i>) Thank you so much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> I believe the new Doctor Hunter
is attending her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> Yes, isn't it too bad? Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Lawty tells me he is a conversationalist, or something
dreadful of that sort. But of course he was
educated in London ... and, my dear, London's
standard of morals is not the same as Northampton's.
I was also told that he treats his wife very
badly in public, my dear, in public.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> You mean&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> My dear Mrs. Warren, I am
very sorry to tell you ... but I feel that it is my
duty, as wife of your pastor ... to tell you that
your daughter Betty has been seen very often,&mdash;that
is, at least once&mdash;walking with this Doctor Hunter.
Also, my dear Mrs. Warren, she accepts presents
from him ... flowers and that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren</span>. Why, Betty hardly knows him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> That is just it. She hardly
knows him ... nor do any of us. Also remember
he is a married man, my dear Mrs. Warren, and very
good looking ... and I really believe all good-looking
people are bad, thoroughly bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> I can't believe that Betty&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> Naturally, my dear, naturally;
you are her mother and wish to shield her. But I
felt that it was, as I said before, my duty to tell you
all I know of the facts of the whole matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> You quite alarm me, Mrs. Pickering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> Young girls, nowadays, are
sometimes ... I might say, sometimes indiscreet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> My dear, men are strange beings.
Oh, the poor souls that have been lured to their
destruction by men. I am always reminded of that
beautiful passage in Genesis which says that woman
was made after man. And isn't it our dear Mr.
Browning who says, "Second thoughts are always
best"? (<i>She puts down her teacup.</i>) There, now, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
really must be going, Mrs. Warren. I am on my
way to the meeting of the "Helping Hand Society"
and I really mustn't be too late. I hope I have not
overly alarmed you, Mrs. Warren, but as one of your
oldest friends and as the wife of your pastor I feel
that I must always do my duty, no matter how painful,
when the way lies open before me. I sincerely
hope you will not feel that I have been ... been
peremptory, so to speak, Mrs. Warren.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> No ... no. It is very kind of
you to come to me in this sad moment of trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> (<i>Rising</i>) I do hope you will
be able to attend the services to-morrow morning.
Mr. Pickering has written a beautiful sermon on the
evils of gossip ... a beautiful sermon. I feel that
it is the best thing he has written in all the forty
years of his righteous work. I am sure it will thunder
down the ages as his masterpiece. The sentiment,
the beautiful English, and even the punctuation
... are really marvelous. Of course, Mr.
Pickering and I both realize that there is <i>very</i> little
gossip in Northampton ... but it is best to know
sin when one encounters it. Good afternoon, Mrs.
Warren.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> (<i>Weakly</i>) Good afternoon.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering</span> goes out. <span class="smcap">Clara</span> enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I have brought the hot water, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Did you call Betty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I knocked at her door, ma'am ... I
knocked very loudly, ma'am, but got no answer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> I am so distressed, Clara. See if
she is in the garden. Yes, she must be in the garden.
(<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> starts.</i>) And Clara, do tell her to
come in and see me at once. I want to talk to her.
It is very important ... oh, most important that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
see her at once. Clara. (<i>The knocker sounds.</i>) See
who that can be, Clara. Oh, more dreadful news,
I fear. (<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> goes into the hall. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren</span>
keeps mumbling to herself:</i>) Most disconcerting
... most dreadfully disconcerting.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> It is Mrs. Lawer, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Eh? What? Who, did you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Mrs. Lawer, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Mrs. Lawer? Oh, do have her
come right in, Clara.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> goes out. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawer</span> enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawer.</span> Good afternoon, Mrs. Warren, good
afternoon. (<i>Breathlessly</i>) How ill, how worried
you are looking, Mrs. Warren. Oh, I am so sorry
for you ... so very sorry. (<i>She sits down.</i>) I
have just seen Mrs. Romney, who had just seen Mrs.
Lawty, and had the dreadful news from her. I am
so sorry, Mrs. Warren.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> But what&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawer.</span> But, of course, we who have known
you for all these years will be as silent as the tomb
... you can depend upon us, lean upon us, call
upon us. We shall comfort you and be your support
in this hour of greatest need.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Why ... why, what do you
mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawer.</span> You really mean to say you do not
know about Betty and Doctor Hunter? Oh, dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> But Betty did nothing so very,
very improper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawer.</span> Improper! Well, of course, we
shall not blame poor Betty, she is still very young,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
but we do blame that wicked Doctor Hunter. Why,
he is a married man, my dear ... and oldish. He
should have known better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> But Betty only walked with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawer.</span> Only walked with him? I was told
that he sends flowers to Betty ... and flowers have
secret meanings. To say the least, they are sentimental.
And Mrs. Lawty told Mrs. Romney that
she heard Betty say with her own lips that Doctor
Hunter was a conversationalist. I believe that means
a person with very free ideas about personal matters
... love, and that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> No, indeed ... it simply means
that he is a very interesting talker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawer.</span> That's just it, Mrs. Warren. What
does he find so much to talk about? I have never
met him, but from things I have heard I believe he
must be a dreadful person. Most unwholesome, so
to speak, to the society&mdash;the very refined society of
Northampton, where for the last forty years we have
all lived in such perfect peace and understanding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Oh, that this should have come
upon me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawer.</span> Your misfortune is our misfortune,
Mrs. Warren. We shall do everything we can to
keep this dreadful scandal&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Scandal! Has it&mdash;has it gone as
far as that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawer.</span> Let us say, indiscretion. As I was
saying, we shall keep it locked in our hearts, no
word of it will ever reach foreign ears. Of course
I really know very little of the whole affair, but I
felt that my first duty was to come to you.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Yes, Clara?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I can't find her, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Oh, do find her, Clara. I must
... I must see her at once. (<i>The knocker sounds.</i>)
Who can that be? Clara ... Clara, see who is at
the door.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> goes out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawer.</span> Oh, Mrs. Warren, trust me in everything
... are you sure Betty has always been what
she seemed ... I mean&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Mrs. Lawer, do you mean to say
that Betty ... Betty Warren ... my daughter&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawer.</span> My dear, we must face the truth
... we must prepare ourselves for the worst ... we
must&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> It's them "Helpin' Hand" ladies, if you
please, ma'am. The lot of 'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Bring them in, Clara ... have
them come right in. Oh! Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawer.</span> You must be calm, my dear ...
perfectly calm.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty</span>, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering</span>, and <span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney</span>
enter from the hall.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Oh, my dear ladies. Do ... do
be seated.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">(<i>They all sit down quietly. There is a long pause.
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering</span> moves restlessly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> Mrs. Warren, we have adjourned
our meeting of the "Helping Hand" until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
next week in order to come to you ... the poor,
dear natives of the South Sea Islands will have to
wait another week for their napkins and tablecloths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> A very short time ... considering
they have not had such necessary luxuries for
several centuries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Still, it was with some feeling of
... of regret that we left our work of altruism unfinished,
until next week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> But we feel that our first duty
is at home. Yes, we all felt that our duty was
toward you, Mrs. Warren, at present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Ladies, I am overcome with your
kindness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> We shall now consider ...
consider ways and means of&mdash;of helping you, Mrs.
Warren, out of this unspeakable&mdash;or, let us say, embarrassing
situation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Let us rather call it ... unfortunate
situation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> No matter what we call it ...
let us get on&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> The facts are these: Mrs.
Lawty tells us she heard Betty, with her own ears,
openly say that the man under consideration, Doctor
Hunter, was a revolutionist and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> I said conversationalist. Though
he probably is both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> I think she must have meant conventionalist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> Nevertheless, one is as bad as
the other. They all go hand in hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> But I believe Betty only said he
was a good conversationalist and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Anyway, she said he talked a lot
about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> I fear it must be one of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
dreadful, sinful new religions one hears so much of
nowadays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Also, we understand from very reliable
sources that Mrs. Hunter is never seen with
her husband in public.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> And that he calls her dreadful
names.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Most suspicious!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> Oh, I don't believe a word of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Believe it or not, Mrs. Romney
... my information is most reliable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Is there any way, ladies, of overcoming
this situation, I mean&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> You might call on Mrs. Hunter
to-morrow, Mrs. Warren.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawer.</span> You might write her a very formal
letter, very formal, my dear, asking her to call.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> Ask Mrs. Hunter to come here?
I think she would never set her foot in the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawer.</span> At any rate, we must do something
at once before&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Before they elope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> (<i>They all begin to talk at once</i>) Before
it is too late. Oh! Ah! But do you really think&mdash;I
never thought of that. Poor Mrs. Warren! Do
you suppose that Mrs. Hunter&mdash;&mdash; Oh! Etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Ladies! Ladies! Do you really
think Betty would&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> One never knows what to think!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Did you find Betty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I went to her room again, ma'am, but she
did not seem to be in and she is nowhere in the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pickering.</span> Not in her room! Not in the
garden!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> You mean, Clara, she is nowhere
to be found? Clara, was her room disturbed ... I
mean, did it look as if ... as if ... as if she might
have left hurriedly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Why, I didn't go in, ma'am. The door
was locked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> Locked?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> (<i>Looking at each other knowingly</i>)
Locked!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Here is a note, ma'am. It was just left
by Doctor Hunter's boy, ma'am.</p>

must have gone through the window!</p>

up.</i>) Ladies, what is the matter? What has happened?
Why are you all so excited?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> Don't you understand? It is a letter

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Why, just taking a little nap, Mother.
Really, I didn't know the ladies were here or I
should have come right down.</p>

Mrs. Pickering, who told&mdash;&mdash;</p>

me that he treated his wife shamefully&mdash;No, I said&mdash;Flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
he sent her flowers every morning&mdash;You
told Mrs. Pickering that he was a conversationalist&mdash;She
said a revolutionist&mdash;I said&mdash;You said&mdash;And
then she said&mdash;Anyway, I do not believe he is a safe
person. But very good looking, my dear. Etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Oh, dear ... what is it all about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> You, my dear, you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Romney.</span> These ladies said that you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawty.</span> These ladies!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> (<i>They all begin to talk at once again</i>)

say a word about&mdash;&mdash; Etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Warren.</span> It was all of them ... every one

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Mother, Mrs. Hunter asks if I might go
for a carriage drive with her this afternoon to gather
wild flowers. She is going to stop for me. She says
the doctor told her how very fond I am of flowers.</p>

<h3>The Touch-Down</h3>

<p>A comedy in four acts, by Marion Short. 8 males, 6 females, but
any number of characters can be introduced in the ensembles. Costumes
modern. One interior scene throughout the play. Time, 2-1/2
hours.</p>

<p>This play, written for the use of clever amateurs, is the story of
life in Siddell, a Pennsylvania co-educational college. It deals with
the vicissitudes and final triumph of the Siddell Football Eleven, and
the humorous and dramatic incidents connected therewith.</p>

<p>"The Touch-Down" has the true varsity atmosphere, college songs
are sung, and the piece is lively and entertaining throughout. High
schools will make no mistake in producing this play. We strongly
recommend it as a high-class and well-written comedy.</p>

<p class="right">
Price, 30 Cents.
</p>


<h3>Hurry, Hurry, Hurry</h3>

<p>A comedy in three acts, by LeRoy Arnold. 5 males, 4 females.
One interior scene. Costumes modern. Plays 2-1/4 hours.</p>

<p>The story is based on the will of an eccentric aunt. It stipulates
that her pretty niece must be affianced before she is twenty-one, and
married to her fianc within a year, if she is to get her spinster
relative's million. Father has nice notions of honor and fails to tell
daughter about the will, so that she may make her choice untrammeled
by any other consideration than that of true love. The action
all takes place in the evening the midnight of which will see her
reach twenty-one. Time is therefore short, and it is hurry, hurry,
hurry, if she is to become engaged and thus save her father from
impending bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The situations are intrinsically funny and the dialogue is sprightly.
The characters are natural and unaffected and the action moves with
a snap such as should be expected from its title.</p>

<p class="right">
Price, 30 Cents.
</p>


<h3>The Varsity Coach</h3>

<p>A three-act play of college life, by Marion Short, specially adapted
to performance by amateurs or high school students. 5 males, 6
females, but any number of boys and girls may be introduced in the
action of the play. Two settings necessary, a college boy's room and
the university campus. Time, about 2 hours.</p>

<p>Like many another college boy, "Bob" Selby, an all-round popular
college man, becomes possessed of the idea that athletic prowess is
more to be desired than scholarship. He is surprised in the midst of
a "spread" in his room in Regatta week by a visit from his aunt
who is putting him through college. Aunt Serena, "a lady of the old
school and the dearest little woman in the whole world," has hastened
to make this visit to her adored nephew under the mistaken impression
that he is about to receive the Fellowes prize for scholarship. Her
grief and chagrin when she learns that instead of the prize Robert
has received "a pink card," which is equivalent to suspension for poor
scholarship, gives a touch of pathos to an otherwise jolly comedy of
college life. How the repentant Robert more than redeems himself,
carries off honors at the last, and in the end wins Ruth, the faithful
little sweetheart of the "Prom" and the classroom, makes a story of
dramatic interest and brings out very clearly certain phases of modern
college life. There are several opportunities for the introduction of
college songs and "stunts."</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
